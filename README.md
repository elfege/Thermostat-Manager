# Thermostat-Manager
This app allows you to manage a thermostat settings in many ways. You can: 
1) Set contact sensors rules for both windows (to save power when windows are open) and inside doors (to coordinate with other thermostats states). 
2) Set a bed sensor that can be made of a DIY touchpad set under your bed and working with contact capability or a simple button to signal the app that you want your sleeping settings to be on, or both options alltogether (contact and button). 
3) Control some DIY windows with switch capability and have them opened, weather permitting, in order to avoid overusing your Air Conditionner. 
4) Use a virtual dimmer that will serve as a desired temperature reference. This permits you to send voice commands with Alexa or Google Home, even when your thermostat is set to off. 
5) You can also use the intelligent automatic evaluation of your needs (in that case you won't need a virtual dimmer): let the app set everything for you. This algorithm is meant to optimize both power saving and comfort, but it can also be customized. 


NB: You'll need to have a weather station for this app to work.
