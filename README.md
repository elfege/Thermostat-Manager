# Thermostat-Manager: the app that learns from your inputs and gets better over time. 
This app allows you to manage a thermostat settings in many ways. It will learn from your input and get more efficient over time. 

Among many other features, you will be able to: 

1) Set contact sensors rules for both windows (to save power when windows are open) and inside doors (to coordinate with other thermostats states). 
2) Push a button to signal the app that you want your sleeping settings to be on. 
3) Control some windows (with switch capability) and have them opened, weather permitting, in order to avoid overusing your Air Conditionner. 
4) Use a virtual dimmer that will serve as a desired temperature reference. Mostly, this is where the app learns from your inputs, even though it'll also learn from some inputs made on your thermostat directly. However, alexa can't adjust a setpoint on a thermostat that is set to "off", which is a bummer. This is why this also facilitates voice commands with Alexa or Google Home, even when your thermostat is set to off. 
5) You can also use the intelligent automatic evaluation of your needs (you will still need a virtual dimmer): let the app set everything for you. This algorithm is meant to optimize both power saving and comfort, but it can also be customized with maxima and minima inputs in settings. 
6) Use a switch to control a heater, another switch to control a cooler to add more power during polar vortex or heat waves. You can set the extra heater to be triggered only when it's really too cold outside.
7) If your alternate heater is connected to a switch with power capability, the app will offer you to use this capability to select a total max power consumption and an order of priority under certain weather conditions: keep power consumption under control. 
8) Use a power meter to assert your HVAC good operation (consistency between power consuption and desired state) so the app can try to send commands again (usefull under bad mesh conditions using Z-wave 1.0 thermostats). 
9) Several air circulation options will allow you to optimize air distribution in your home when the thermostat is cooling. 


NB: You'll need to have a weather station or a temperature sensor located outside your home.
