# Thermostat-Manager
This app allows you to manage a thermostat settings in many ways. You can set contact sensors rules for both windows (to save power when windows are open) and inside doors (to coordinate with other thermostats states), set a bed sensor that can be made of a DIY touchpad set under your bed and working with contact capability or a simple button to signal the app that you want your sleeping settings to be on, or both options alltogether (contact and button). This app can also control some DIY windows with switch capability open them, weather permitting, to avoid overusing your Air Conditionner.
You'll need to have a weather station for this app to work.
