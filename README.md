# Thermostat-Manager
This app allows you to manage a thermostat settings in many ways. You can: 
1) Set contact sensors rules for both windows (to save power when windows are open) and inside doors (to coordinate with other thermostats states). 
2) Push a button to signal the app that you want your sleeping settings to be on. 
3) Control some DIY windows with switch capability and have them opened, weather permitting, in order to avoid overusing your Air Conditionner. 
4) Use a virtual dimmer that will serve as a desired temperature reference. This permits you to send voice commands with Alexa or Google Home, even when your thermostat is set to off. 
5) You can also use the intelligent automatic evaluation of your needs (in that case you won't need a virtual dimmer): let the app set everything for you. This algorithm is meant to optimize both power saving and comfort, but it can also be customized. 
6) Use switch to control a heater, another switch to control a cooler. 
7) Use a power meter to assert your HVAC good operation (consistency between power consuption and desired state) so the app can try to send commands again (usefull under bad mesh conditions). 
8) If your alternate heater is connected to a switch with power capability, the app will offer you to use this feature to select a total max power consumption and an order of priority under certain weather conditions :  use the extra heater only when it's really cold outside and control power consumption at the same time. 


NB: You'll need to have a weather station or a temperature sensor located outside your home for this app to work properly.
